<h2>Hello !</h2>
I'm Patryk Kania and i am 24 years old programmer from Tychy from Poland.
 For now i'm working as a Junior Java/Salesforce Developer in Accenture.
 I also study at the University of Economics in Katowice.
 Apart from programming, my second hobby is American football.
 I am currently playing for the team Tychy Falcons, which is in the highest league in Poland.<br/><br/>
<h2>And here it is - My Bachelor thesis</h2>
In Poland, in the last year of studies, we write a bachelor's thesis, which in the case of
 IT is a larger programming project (most often).
 I came up with the idea for a smart terrarium when I met a my friend Adrian.
 He is a breeder of wild animals such as agams, snakes and spiders.<br/>
At one point he asked me "Can you automate my terrariums?". <b>And here it is - My Bachelor thesis</b><br/><br/>
<h2>My university</h2>
I have a year to do a project and describe it. But unfortunately that's not all.
 In addition to the project, we need to know the answer to 100 questions that have been previously prepared.
 The questions cover not only programming but also math, algorithms and data structure, databases and networks.
 All work is supervised by the promoter and depending on him, further requirements for my project are set.<br/><br/>
<h2>What's next</h2>
I plan to establish cooperation with a company that professionally deals with the creation and equipment of terrariums.
 All this to ensure the highest quality of our products and to ensure the best price conditions.<br/>
 You will find out everything about the functionality of the terrarium in the post that will appear soon.
