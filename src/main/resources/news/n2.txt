<h2>First about the website</h2>
What you see on your site now is sure to change - for the better.
 In the near future, I would like the graphics and functionality of the website to be taken care
 of by a person who deals with it professionally (and which has a better sense of aesthetics :D ).
 For now, however, the most important thing for me is that your terrarium works as well as possible.<br/><br/>
<h2>Basic functionalities</h2>
Below I will introduce you to the basic functionalities of the terrarium, which I am going to introduce to the start.
<ul>
    <li>Tracking current measurements</li>
    <li>Remote instrument activation</li>
    <li>Opening / closing sensor</li>
    <li>Automatic terrarium management</li>
    <li>Alert system</li>
</ul>
There will certainly be much more functionality in the future.
 I already have a few ideas, but for now I will focus on the above-mentioned. I think it's enough for a good start.<br/><br/>
<h2>Something underneath</h2>
Your safety is equally important (if not the most important). By yours I mean your data.
 Uses the latest methods of securing the application to best protect against hacker attacks.
 You certainly do not want your personal data to be disclosed,
 the amount of your equipment and how much you pay for our services. We don't want that either.
 Creating a safe application is my priority, so I think because you can sleep well.<br/><br/>
 There are also plans to integrate with other services such as Facebook, Instagram or Google.
 This will allow you to easily share information from our website on social media
 as well as log in using external websites (e.g. logging in with a Google account).<br/><br/>
<h2>Tracking current measurements</h2>
Tracking current measurements such as temperature measurement, humidity measurement,
 light intensity level will allow you to better understand what is happening in your terrarium.
 In addition, thanks to the UVA and UVB sensors, you are able to determine whether your bulbs are suitable
 for replacement or help you confirm that you have bought the wrong one.<br/><br/>
Can you see that in your terrarium is too bright ?<br/>
Can you see that your terrarium is too dry ?<br/><br/>
It's not a problem ! You can remotely change the intensity of the light or turn on humidification.
 It has never been easier, just press a button or move a slider.<br/><br/>
<h2>Opening / closing sensor</h2>
Have you ever left the house and forgot whether you turned off the iron or not ?<br/>
 Maybe if you are a breeder you have set up or closed your terrarium.<br/>
 We will help you with that too.
 Just go to the website and check what the closing / opening icon shows.<br/><br/>
<h2>Automatic terrarium management</h2>
 Can you get even more help ?<br/>
 You are tired of constantly checking measurements ?<br/><br/>
 Our robot will help you, just turn it on. stands right next to your terrarium icon.
 Set the values you would like to get and he will make sure to keep them
 and if you do not know what settings would be good for your pet, we have prepared some basic environments
 with default values. Just select an environment from the list.<br/><br/>
<h2>Alert system</h2>
In case of too high temperature or an empty water container, we will notify you.
 Alerts can be seen on the home page. We will notify you also is the given value will approach the limit value.
 Outside of our website, you will also receive an email about the alert.
 In the future, I also plan to provide information about the problem via SMS.<br/><br/>
<h2>Additionally</h2>
If you have any idea how you can improve / automate the terrarium - share this idea with us.
